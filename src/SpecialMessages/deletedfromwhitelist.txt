Hi,

you are a registered user but you are not on my whitelist anymore, so I am not 
allowed to handle your e-mails.

Maybe you have missed a deadline and have been dropped out of this course.

If you think that you should still be on my whitelist, drop your instructor an 
e-mail so he can take care of it.

So long, and thanks for all the fish!
