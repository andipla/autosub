The VELS System has three major databases:
1) semester
2) course
3) semeststats

Tables and fields are written in camel case with a leading uppercase letter.

Connection to these databases via sqlite 3 shall be established using the following rules:

1) All classes which have the paths to the databases as member variables shall connect to the database
locally in the function, cur or con shall not be passed to other functions

2) All functions which are not part of a class that has the paths to the databases, shall get the paths 
as parameters

3) To clearly identify the connections the following naming convention shall be upheld:
	cons, curs for connections to semester
	conc, curc for connections to course
	const, curst for connections to semesterstats
