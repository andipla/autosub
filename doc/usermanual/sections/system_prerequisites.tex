\section{Autosub \& Tasks Prerequisites} \label{system_prerequisites}

In the following, the installation of pre-requisites for autosub and the tasks
are documented for Debian. The system might work with other distributions, if you
find the packages that have to be installed, please provide us with instructions
so we can expand this section.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Debian 7 (Wheezy)}

Installs from the apt package pool:

\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-mock python3-pip python3-nose
sudo apt-get install zip flip git gnat-4.6-base libgnat-4.6
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra pgf graphviz build-dep
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev rsync
\end{verbatim}

Next we need to upgrade easy\_install for python3 to a newer version -- this
is the pre-requisite for the installation of the matplotlib for python3.

\begin{verbatim}
easy_install3 -U distribute
\end{verbatim}

The following packages need to be installed using pip:

\begin{verbatim}
pip-3.2 install pyqt5
pip-3.2 install matplotlib
pip-3.2 install bitstring
pip-3.2 install graphviz
pip-3.2 install jinja2
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
sudo apt-get install python3  python3-mock python3-pip python3-nose
sudo apt-get install zip flip git gnat-4.9-base libgnat-4.9
sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra pgf graphviz  build-dep
sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev python3-pyqt5 python3-matplotlib rsync
\end{verbatim}

The following packages need to be installed using pip:

\begin{verbatim}
pip3 install bitstring
pip3 install graphviz
pip3 install jinja2
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Patches to be applied}
Unfortunately there is a small bug in one of the latex packages that we use
(pst-circ), therefore you need to apply a patch to that package:

\begin{verbatim}
cd /usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/generic/pst-circ
patch < /path/to/autosub/doc/patch/pst-circ.tex.patch
\end{verbatim}

In case logic gates in the pdfs you are not beautiful as you are used to, it might have
happended that an update was applied over that patch and you need to re-apply it.
